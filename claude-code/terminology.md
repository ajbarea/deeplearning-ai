# AI Course Terminology

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Definition**: A technique that combines information retrieval with generative AI. The system first retrieves relevant documents/data from a knowledge base, then uses that context to generate more accurate and informed responses.

**Example**: A chatbot that searches through company documentation before answering questions, rather than relying solely on its training data.

## Chatbot

**Definition**: An AI-powered conversational interface that can understand and respond to user messages in natural language.

**Example**: Customer service bots, virtual assistants like Claude, or domain-specific help systems that can answer questions and perform tasks through conversation.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Definition**: An open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to data sources and tools. It allows Claude and other AI models to access external resources like databases, APIs, and services in a standardized way.

**Example**: Using MCP to connect Claude to your GitHub repository, local file system, or a company database so it can read and interact with that data during conversations.
